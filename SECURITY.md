# Security Policy

The Personal AI Agent prioritizes security through a local-first architecture that keeps user data on their device by default. This document outlines our security approach, vulnerability reporting process, and the technical security measures implemented throughout the system.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate the efforts of security researchers and our user community in helping us maintain a secure application.

To report a security vulnerability:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until we've had a chance to address it
2. Email details of the vulnerability to security@personalai.example.com
3. Include:
   - A description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggestions for mitigation

Our security team will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and provide an estimated timeline for addressing the issue. We follow responsible disclosure practices and will keep you informed throughout the process.

## Security Architecture

The Personal AI Agent implements a comprehensive security architecture designed around user privacy and data protection, with security controls across all application layers.

### Local-First Security Model

Our security model is fundamentally different from cloud-based AI assistants:

- All user data stored locally on the user's device by default
- End-to-end encryption for any optional cloud features
- Zero-knowledge architecture where only the user has access to their data
- Minimal data sharing with external services, only when explicitly enabled by the user

This approach shifts the security boundary to the user's device, dramatically reducing the attack surface compared to cloud-based alternatives.

### Security Zones

The application implements distinct security zones with specific controls:

1. **High Security Zone**: Contains encryption keys, credentials, and sensitive user data
   - Strongest encryption
   - Limited API access
   - Full authentication required
   - Minimal access patterns

2. **Standard Security Zone**: Includes core services and memory system
   - Standard encryption
   - Basic authentication
   - Functional access controls

3. **User Interaction Zone**: Covers UI components and voice interface
   - Input validation
   - Minimal data retention
   - User presence verification

4. **External Zone**: Third-party APIs and services
   - API authentication
   - Data minimization
   - End-to-end encryption
   - TLS protection

### Threat Model

Our threat model considers several potential attack vectors:

1. **Device access threats**: Physical access to user device, malware
2. **Network threats**: Man-in-the-middle attacks, API interception
3. **External service threats**: Third-party service compromise, API key leakage
4. **Application threats**: Vulnerabilities in application code, dependency issues
5. **Social engineering**: Phishing attempts to gain user credentials or data

Each threat category has specific mitigations implemented, as detailed in the Threat Model and Mitigations section.

## Encryption Standards

The Personal AI Agent implements industry-standard encryption throughout the application to protect user data.

### Data at Rest

All data stored locally is encrypted using:

- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard with 256-bit keys in Galois/Counter Mode)
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) with high iteration counts
- **Initialization Vectors**: Unique per file/database to prevent pattern analysis
- **Storage Locations**:
  - SQLite database encryption
  - Vector database encryption
  - File system encryption for documents and media

```python
# Example of secure encryption implementation
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead import AESGCM
import os

def encrypt_data(data, key=None):
    """Encrypt data using AES-GCM with a secure key."""
    if key is None:
        key = os.urandom(32)  # Generate a secure random key
    nonce = os.urandom(12)    # Generate a secure nonce
    cipher = AESGCM(key)
    ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(nonce, data, None)
    return nonce + ciphertext, key
```

### Data in Transit

For data transmitted between the application and external services:

- **Protocol**: TLS 1.3 (Transport Layer Security) with strong cipher suites
- **Certificate Validation**: Strict validation with pinning for critical services
- **Additional Encryption**: Payload-level encryption for sensitive data
- **Authentication**: Secure API authentication with minimal-scope tokens

### Key Management

The application implements a hierarchical key management approach:

1. **Master Key**:
   - Derived from user passphrase or device security features
   - Protected by platform-specific secure storage
   - Optional biometric protection

2. **Data Encryption Keys**:
   - Generated per data category
   - Encrypted with master key
   - Rotated periodically

3. **Backup Keys**:
   - User-controlled keys for cloud backup
   - Separate from master key for isolation
   - Recovery phrases provided to user

Keys are never stored in plaintext and are only held in memory while in active use.

## Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication Methods

The Personal AI Agent employs a multi-layered authentication approach:

1. **Device-level authentication**:
   - Leverages native OS security (fingerprint, face ID, etc.)
   - Provides baseline application access

2. **Application-level authentication (optional)**:
   - PIN codes (minimum 6 digits, no repeated patterns)
   - Passwords (8+ chars, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
   - Biometric (using platform APIs)
   - Exponential backoff after failed attempts

3. **Feature-specific authentication**:
   - Critical operations may require re-authentication
   - Sensitive data access requires authentication verification

### Session Management

- **Session Duration**: Configurable (default: 30 minutes)
- **Termination Triggers**: Inactivity timeout, explicit logout
- **Persistence**: Minimal session state (local app)
- **Re-authentication**: Required for sensitive operations

### Authorization Controls

The application implements a capability-based authorization model:

- **Feature Access**: Based on authentication level
- **External Services**: Explicit user consent required
- **Data Access**: Permission-based with sensitivity levels
- **File System Access**: Explicit permission per folder
- **Web Access**: Allow/deny lists with user configuration

All authorization decisions follow the principle of least privilege, requiring explicit user consent for operations that:
- Access external services
- Modify system settings
- Export or import data
- Access sensitive stored information

## Data Security

Local data is protected through multiple security layers:

- **Database Encryption**: Full database encryption for SQLite and vector databases
- **Secure Key Storage**: Platform-specific secure storage mechanisms
