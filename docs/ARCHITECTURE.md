# Architecture Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Personal AI Agent's architecture, detailing the system's components, interactions, data flow, and design principles with a focus on the local-first, privacy-oriented approach.

## 1. Introduction

Overview of the Personal AI Agent architecture, its design principles, and key architectural decisions.

### 1.1 Design Principles

Core principles guiding the architecture: local-first approach, privacy by design, modularity, extensibility, and resilience.

-   **Local-First**: All user data is stored locally on the user's device by default, ensuring privacy and control.
-   **Privacy by Design**: Security and privacy considerations are integrated into every stage of the design process.
-   **Modularity**: The system is composed of loosely coupled, independent components that can be developed, tested, and deployed separately.
-   **Extensibility**: The architecture supports the addition of new features and integrations through well-defined interfaces and plugin mechanisms.
-   **Resilience**: The system is designed to handle failures gracefully, with fallback mechanisms and error handling strategies in place.

### 1.2 Key Architectural Decisions

Explanation of major architectural decisions including local-first storage, hybrid database approach, service-oriented design, and optional cloud integration.

-   **Local-First Storage**: The decision to prioritize local storage was driven by the need to provide users with complete control over their data and minimize privacy risks associated with cloud storage.
-   **Hybrid Database Approach**: The system uses a combination of a vector database (ChromaDB) for semantic search and a relational database (SQLite) for structured data storage. This approach balances the need for efficient information retrieval with the need for structured data management.
-   **Service-Oriented Design**: The architecture is based on a service-oriented design, with well-defined service boundaries and communication patterns. This approach promotes modularity, testability, and maintainability.
-   **Optional Cloud Integration**: The system supports optional cloud integration for backup and synchronization purposes. This feature is designed to be opt-in and provides users with control over whether their data is stored in the cloud.
