# Privacy Policy - Personal AI Agent

## Introduction

The Personal AI Agent is built on a foundation of privacy-first principles, putting you in complete control of your data. Unlike many AI assistants that store your information in the cloud, our local-first architecture ensures your conversations, documents, and preferences remain on your device by default.

We believe that powerful AI assistance shouldn't come at the cost of your privacy. That's why we've designed every aspect of the Personal AI Agent with transparency and user control as guiding principles. You always know where your data is stored, how it's used, and have comprehensive tools to manage it.

## Data Storage

### Local-First Approach

By default, all your data is stored locally on your device:

- **Conversations**: Chat history and context
- **Documents**: Processed files and extracted information
- **Web Content**: Information extracted from web pages
- **Memories**: Vector embeddings and associated metadata
- **Preferences**: All application settings and configurations

Your data never leaves your device unless you explicitly enable optional features that require external services.

### Encryption Standards

All data stored locally is protected using AES-256-GCM encryption, a military-grade encryption standard. This ensures your information remains secure even if your device is compromised.

### Optional Cloud Backup

If you choose to enable cloud backup, your data is:
- End-to-end encrypted before leaving your device
- Encrypted using keys that only you control
- Never accessible to us or the cloud storage provider
- Only stored in the regions you select for compliance purposes

You maintain complete control over backup frequency, content, and storage location.

## External Services

The Personal AI Agent can optionally integrate with external services to enhance functionality. All external services are:

- **Disabled by default**
- **Opt-in only**
- **Configurable individually**
- **Clearly indicated in the user interface**

### Optional External Services

| Service Type | Purpose | User Control |
|--------------|---------|--------------|
| LLM API (e.g., OpenAI) | Text generation and processing | Enable/disable, select provider |
| Voice Services | Speech-to-text and text-to-speech | Enable/disable, select provider |
| Web Search | Retrieve information from the internet | Enable/disable, configure sources |
| Cloud Storage | Encrypted backup of your data | Enable/disable, select provider and region |

### Transparency Indicators

The application interface always clearly indicates:
- When external services are being used
- What data is being sent externally
- The privacy implications of each operation

Look for the status indicators at the bottom of the screen that show whether you're in "Local Only" mode or using external services.

## Data Sharing

We follow a minimal data sharing philosophy. When you enable external services:

### LLM Services (e.g., OpenAI)
- Only the necessary conversation context is sent
- Customizable context window to control what's shared
- No user identification information is included
- Communication is secured with TLS encryption

### Voice Processing
- Audio data is processed in chunks
- Processed immediately and not stored by the service
- Only sent when actively using voice features
- Temporary files deleted after processing

### Web Content and Search
- Only the specific URL or search query is sent
- Results are stored locally on your device
- No browsing history or patterns are tracked

## User Controls

You have comprehensive controls to manage your privacy:

### External Service Controls
- Enable or disable each external service individually
- Configure which providers to use
- Set usage limits and quotas
- Receive notifications when external services are used

### Data Management
- Export all your data in standard formats
- Selectively delete specific conversations, documents, or memories
- Complete data purge option to erase all stored information
- Memory management interface to review and edit stored information

### Local-Only Mode
- Option to operate entirely offline
- Use local models for text and voice processing
- Disable all external connections
- No data leaves your device

## Security Measures

### Local Data Protection
- AES-256-GCM encryption for all stored data
- Secure key derivation using your device's security features
- Optional application-level authentication (PIN, password, biometric)
- Secure memory handling to prevent data leakage

### Cloud Data Protection
- End-to-end encryption for all cloud backups
- User-controlled encryption keys
- Zero-knowledge architecture (we cannot access your data)
- Secure key backup options with recovery phrases

### API Security
- Secure storage of API keys in your device's secure enclave/keychain
- Minimal permission scopes for external services
- Automatic token rotation and refresh
- No persistent tokens stored in plaintext

### Communication Security
- TLS 1.3 for all external communications
- Certificate validation and pinning for critical services
- Additional payload encryption for sensitive data
- Secure WebSockets for real-time communication

## Telemetry and Analytics

### No Default Telemetry
- No usage data is collected by default
- No diagnostic information is sent without consent
- No user identification or tracking

### Opt-In Analytics
If you choose to help improve the application:
- All analytics are anonymized
- No personally identifiable information is collected
- Data is aggregated and cannot be linked to individual users
- You can view exactly what information is shared

### Crash Reporting
- Opt-in crash reporting to help fix issues
- Reports exclude personal content
- Focus on technical information only
- You can review reports before sending

### Local Analytics
- Usage statistics are stored locally
- Available in your dashboard
- Never sent externally without consent
- Helps you understand your usage patterns

## Compliance

### GDPR Compliance
- Right to access your data (already available as it's on your device)
- Right to rectification through the memory management interface
- Right to erasure with comprehensive deletion tools
- Right to data portability with export functionality
- Privacy by design and default through our local-first architecture

### CCPA Compliance
- Complete transparency about data collection (minimal to none)
- User control over any data sharing with third parties
- Comprehensive deletion capabilities
- No sale of personal information

### Data Subject Rights
As all data is stored locally on your device, you have inherent control over your information. Our design ensures you can:
- Access all your data directly
- Modify or delete your data at any time
- Export your data in standard formats
- Restrict processing by disabling external services

### Data Retention
- You control how long data is stored
- Optional automatic archiving of old conversations
- Configurable retention policies for different data types
- No server-side storage except for opt-in cloud backup
