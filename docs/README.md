# Personal AI Agent Documentation

## Introduction

This is the comprehensive documentation for the Personal AI Agent, a local-first, memory-augmented AI companion designed to provide users with a private, customizable assistant that stores all information directly on their devices.

## Overview

The Personal AI Agent is a desktop and mobile application that provides an AI companion with the following primary capabilities:

- Conversational Interface: Text and voice-based interaction with context-aware responses
- Memory Management: Local vector database storing conversation history and knowledge
- Document Processing: Ability to read, analyze, and extract information from various file formats
- Web Integration: Search capabilities and webpage reading for real-time information
- Customization: User-defined personality, voice, and behavior settings

The architecture follows a local-first approach with a Python backend, TypeScript frontend, and vector database for efficient information retrieval. The system leverages large language models (either cloud-based or local) for natural language understanding and generation.

## Key Features

- **Privacy-First Design**: All user data stored locally by default
- **Memory Augmentation**: AI remembers past conversations and learns from user interactions
- **Document Understanding**: Process and extract information from PDFs, Word documents, and more
- **Web Integration**: Search the web and extract information from websites
- **Voice Interaction**: Natural speech recognition and synthesis
- **Customizable Personality**: Adjust the AI's tone, style, and behavior
- **Local LLM Support**: Option to run entirely offline with local language models
