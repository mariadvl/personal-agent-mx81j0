## Security Architecture

The Personal AI Agent implements a comprehensive security architecture designed around user privacy and data protection, with security controls across all application layers.

### Local-First Security Model

Our security model is fundamentally different from cloud-based AI assistants:

- All user data stored locally on the user's device by default
- End-to-end encryption for any optional cloud features
- Zero-knowledge architecture where only the user has access to their data
- Minimal data sharing with external services, only when explicitly enabled by the user

This approach shifts the security boundary to the user's device, dramatically reducing the attack surface compared to cloud-based alternatives.

### Security Zones

The application implements distinct security zones with specific controls:

1. **High Security Zone**: Contains encryption keys, credentials, and sensitive user data
   - Strongest encryption
   - Limited API access
   - Full authentication required
   - Minimal access patterns

2. **Standard Security Zone**: Includes core services and memory system
   - Standard encryption
   - Basic authentication
   - Functional access controls

3. **User Interaction Zone**: Covers UI components and voice interface
   - Input validation
   - Minimal data retention
   - User presence verification

4. **External Zone**: Third-party APIs and services
   - API authentication
   - Data minimization
   - End-to-end encryption
   - TLS protection

### Threat Model

Our threat model considers several potential attack vectors:

1. **Device access threats**: Physical access to user device, malware
2. **Network threats**: Man-in-the-middle attacks, API interception
3. **External service threats**: Third-party service compromise, API key leakage
4. **Application threats**: Vulnerabilities in application code, dependency issues
5. **Social engineering**: Phishing attempts to gain user credentials or data

Each threat category has specific mitigations implemented, as detailed in the Threat Model and Mitigations section.

## Encryption Standards

The Personal AI Agent implements industry-standard encryption throughout the application to protect user data.

### Data at Rest

All data stored locally is encrypted using:

- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard with 256-bit keys in Galois/Counter Mode)
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) with high iteration counts
- **Initialization Vectors**: Unique per file/database to prevent pattern analysis
- **Storage Locations**:
  - SQLite database encryption
  - Vector database encryption
  - File system encryption for documents and media

```python
# Example of secure encryption implementation
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead import AESGCM
import os

def encrypt_data(data, key=None):
    """Encrypt data using AES-GCM with a secure key."""
    if key is None:
        key = os.urandom(32)  # Generate a secure random key
    nonce = os.urandom(12)    # Generate a secure nonce
    cipher = AESGCM(key)
    ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(nonce, data, None)
    return nonce + ciphertext, key
```

### Data in Transit

For data transmitted between the application and external services:

- **Protocol**: TLS 1.3 (Transport Layer Security) with strong cipher suites
- **Certificate Validation**: Strict validation with pinning for critical services
- **Additional Encryption**: Payload-level encryption for sensitive data
- **Authentication**: Secure API authentication with minimal-scope tokens

### Key Management

The application implements a hierarchical key management approach:

1. **Master Key**:
   - Derived from user passphrase or device security features
   - Protected by platform-specific secure storage
   - Optional biometric protection

2. **Data Encryption Keys**:
   - Generated per data category
   - Encrypted with master key
   - Rotated periodically

3. **Backup Keys**:
   - User-controlled keys for cloud backup
   - Separate from master key for isolation
   - Recovery phrases provided to user

Keys are never stored in plaintext and are only held in memory while in active use.

## Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication Methods

The Personal AI Agent employs a multi-layered authentication approach:

1. **Device-level authentication**:
   - Leverages native OS security (fingerprint, face ID, etc.)
   - Provides baseline application access

2. **Application-level authentication (optional)**:
   - PIN codes (minimum 6 digits, no repeated patterns)
   - Passwords (8+ chars, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
   - Biometric (using platform APIs)
   - Exponential backoff after failed attempts

3. **Feature-specific authentication**:
   - Critical operations may require re-authentication
   - Sensitive data access requires authentication verification

### Session Management

- **Session Duration**: Configurable (default: 30 minutes)
- **Termination Triggers**: Inactivity timeout, explicit logout
- **Persistence**: Minimal session state (local app)
- **Re-authentication**: Required for sensitive operations

### Authorization Controls

The application implements a capability-based authorization model:

- **Feature Access**: Based on authentication level
- **External Services**: Explicit user consent required
- **Data Access**: Permission-based with sensitivity levels
- **File System Access**: Explicit permission per folder
- **Web Access**: Allow/deny lists with user configuration

All authorization decisions follow the principle of least privilege, requiring explicit user consent for operations that:
- Access external services
- Modify system settings
- Export or import data
- Access sensitive stored information

## Data Security

### Local Storage Security

Local data is protected through multiple security layers:

- **Database Encryption**: Full database encryption for SQLite and vector databases
- **Secure Key Storage**: Platform-specific secure storage mechanisms
  - Windows: Windows Data Protection API
  - macOS: Keychain
  - Linux: Secret Service API
  - Mobile: Secure Enclave / Keystore
- **Memory Protection**: Sensitive data cleared from memory after use
- **Access Controls**: File system permissions and application-level controls
- **Integrity Verification**: Database integrity checks on startup

### Optional Cloud Backup Security

For users who enable optional cloud backup:

- **Local Deletion**: Secure overwrite of sensitive data
- **Database Cleanup**: Proper deletion with database vacuuming
- **Backup Removal**: Complete removal from cloud backup when deleted locally
- **File Shredding**: Multi-pass overwrite for sensitive files
- **Memory Clearing**: Explicit zeroing of sensitive data in memory

## External Service Security

### API Security

For optional external service integrations:

- **API Key Management**:
  - Encrypted storage using platform security features
  - Memory-only decryption when needed
  - Automatic and manual key rotation support
- **Request Security**:
  - TLS 1.3 for all API communications
  - Request signing where supported
  - Minimal data transmission

```typescript
// Example of secure API request with authentication
async function secureApiRequest(endpoint: string, data: any) {
  const headers = new Headers();
  
  // Add authentication token if available
  const authToken = await getSecureToken();
  if (authToken) {
    headers.append('Authorization', `Bearer ${authToken}`);
  }
  
  // Set secure headers
  headers.append('Content-Type', 'application/json');
  headers.append('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff');
  
  const response = await fetch(endpoint, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers,
    body: JSON.stringify(data),
  });
  
  return response.json();
}
```

- **Rate Limiting**:
  - Local rate limiting to prevent abuse
  - Exponential backoff for failed requests
  - User notifications for usage limits

### Third-Party Service Integration

When integrating with external services:

- **Minimal Permissions**: Only necessary permissions requested
- **Data Minimization**: Only required data sent to services
- **Privacy Indicators**: Clear UI indicators when external services are used
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

## Security FAQ

### General Security Questions

**Q: Is my data sent to the cloud?**  
A: No, by default all your data is stored locally on your device. Cloud features are strictly opt-in and use end-to-end encryption.

**Q: Can the development team access my data?**  
A: No, we have no access to your data. The local-first design means your data stays on your device, and any optional cloud backups are encrypted with keys only you control.

**Q: How do I report a security vulnerability?**  
A: Please email security@personalai.example.com with details. We follow [Responsible Disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure) practices and will work with you to address any issues.

**Q: What happens if my device is lost or stolen?**  
A: Your data is protected by encryption. If you've enabled device-level or application-level authentication, this provides an additional security layer. We recommend enabling these features.

**Q: How are API keys for external services protected?**  
A: API keys are stored in your device's secure storage mechanism (Keychain, Secure Enclave, etc.) and are only decrypted in memory when needed for API calls.

### Technical Security Questions

**Q: What encryption algorithms are used?**  
A: We use AES-256-GCM for data encryption, with PBKDF2 for key derivation. All network communications use TLS 1.3.

**Q: How are encryption keys managed?**  
A: We use a hierarchical key management system with a master key (derived from your device security or passphrase) that encrypts individual data encryption keys.

**Q: Is the application vulnerable to memory dump attacks?**  
A: We implement secure memory handling practices, including explicit clearing of sensitive data from memory after use and guards against memory dumps.

**Q: How are database transactions secured?**  
A: Database files are encrypted at rest, and we use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. Transactions follow ACID principles to maintain data integrity.

**Q: What happens during a security breach at an external service provider?**  
A: Our minimal data sharing approach means that even if an external service provider experiences a breach, your personal data exposure is limited. We would notify users and provide guidance on any necessary actions.
