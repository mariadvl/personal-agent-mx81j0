- **Accessibility**: Making the application usable by people with diverse abilities
- **User experience**: Testing from the user's perspective

### Testing Scope

The testing strategy covers:

- Backend Python services and APIs
- Frontend web components and pages
- Mobile application interfaces
- Desktop application functionality
- Cross-cutting concerns like security and performance

## Testing Approaches

The Personal AI Agent employs multiple testing approaches to ensure comprehensive coverage of all aspects of the application.

### Unit Testing

Unit tests verify the correctness of individual components in isolation.

**Backend Unit Testing:**
- **Framework**: Pytest
- **Location**: `src/backend/tests/unit/`
- **Coverage Target**: 85% line coverage, 80% branch coverage
- **Key Areas**:
  - Service classes (conversation, memory, document processing)
  - Utility functions (embeddings, text processing)
  - API route handlers

**Frontend Unit Testing:**
- **Framework**: Jest with React Testing Library
- **Location**: `src/web/__tests__/`
- **Coverage Target**: 80% line coverage, 75% branch coverage
- **Key Areas**:
  - React components
  - Custom hooks
  - State management
  - Utility functions

**Example Backend Unit Test:**
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_store_memory():
    # Arrange
    mock_memory_storage = AsyncMock()
    mock_memory_storage.store_memory.return_value = {
        "id": "test-id",
        "content": "Test memory content",
        "metadata": {"source": "test"}
    }
    mock_memory_retriever = AsyncMock()
    mock_context_manager = AsyncMock()
    mock_event_bus = AsyncMock()
    
    memory_service = MemoryService(
        memory_storage=mock_memory_storage,
        memory_retriever=mock_memory_retriever,
        context_manager=mock_context_manager,
        event_bus=mock_event_bus
    )
    
    # Act
    result = await memory_service.store_memory(
        content="Test memory content",
        metadata={"source": "test"}
    )
    
    # Assert
    mock_memory_storage.store_memory.assert_called_once_with(
        content="Test memory content",
        metadata={"source": "test"}
    )
    assert result["id"] == "test-id"
    assert result["content"] == "Test memory content"
    mock_event_bus.publish.assert_called_once()
```

**Example Frontend Unit Test:**
```typescript
describe('MessageInput', () => {
  it('submits message when send button is clicked', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const sendMessage = jest.fn();
    jest.spyOn(useConversation, 'default').mockReturnValue({
      sendMessage,
      isSending: false
    });
    
    render(<MessageInput />);
    
    // Act
    const input = screen.getByTestId('message-input');
    const sendButton = screen.getByTestId('send-button');
    
    await userEvent.type(input, 'Hello AI');
    await userEvent.click(sendButton);
    
    // Assert
    expect(sendMessage).toHaveBeenCalledWith('Hello AI');
    expect(input).toHaveValue('');
  });
});
```

### Integration Testing

Integration tests verify that different components work together correctly.

**Backend Integration Testing:**
- **Framework**: Pytest
- **Location**: `src/backend/tests/integration/`
- **Key Areas**:
  - API endpoints with real service interactions
  - Database operations with actual databases
  - Vector search functionality with real embeddings
  - Document processing pipeline

**Frontend Integration Testing:**
- **Framework**: Jest with React Testing Library
- **Location**: `src/web/__tests__/integration/`
- **Key Areas**:
  - Component interactions
  - State management across components
  - API client integration

**Example Backend Integration Test:**
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_vector_search_with_filters():
    # Arrange
    vector_db = VectorDatabase(TEST_VECTOR_DB_DIR)
    
    # Create test embeddings with different categories
    ids, vectors, metadatas, texts = create_test_embeddings(10, 384)
    for i in range(len(ids)):
        metadatas[i]["category"] = "category_" + str(i % 3)
    
    # Add embeddings to database
    await vector_db.batch_add_embeddings(ids, vectors, metadatas, texts)
    
    # Act - search with category filter
    query_vector = generate_random_embedding(384)
    results = await vector_db.search_similar(
        vector=query_vector,
        limit=10,
        filters={"category": "category_1"}
    )
    
    # Assert
    assert len(results) > 0
    for result in results:
        assert result["metadata"]["category"] == "category_1"
    
    # Cleanup
    await vector_db.close()
```

**Example API Integration Test:**
```python
def test_conversation_api_returns_response(app_client, mock_llm_service):
    # Arrange
    mock_llm_service.generate_response.return_value = "I'm an AI assistant."
    payload = {"message": "Hello, who are you?"}
    
    # Act
    response = app_client.post("/api/conversation", json=payload)
    
    # Assert
    assert response.status_code == 200
    data = response.json()
    assert "response" in data
    assert data["response"] == "I'm an AI assistant."
    assert "conversation_id" in data
```

### End-to-End Testing

End-to-end tests verify complete user flows and scenarios.

**Framework**: Cypress
**Location**: `src/web/cypress/e2e/`
**Key Scenarios**:
- Complete conversation flow
- Document upload and processing
- Memory management
- Settings configuration
- Voice interaction

**Example E2E Test:**
```typescript
describe('Conversation Flow', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.intercept('POST', '/api/conversation', {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: {
        response: "I'm an AI assistant, how can I help you today?",
        conversation_id: '123-abc'
      }
    }).as('sendMessage');
    
    cy.visit('/chat');
  });
  
  it('should send message and display response', () => {
    // Act
    cy.get('[data-testid=message-input]')
      .type('Hello AI{enter}');
    
    cy.wait('@sendMessage');
    
    // Assert
    cy.get('[data-testid=message-list]')
      .should('contain.text', 'Hello AI')
      .and('contain.text', "I'm an AI assistant, how can I help you today?");
  });
});
```

### Performance Testing

Performance tests verify that the application meets performance requirements.

**Tools**:
- k6 for API load testing
- Pytest benchmarks for critical operations
- Lighthouse for frontend performance

**Key Performance Metrics**:
- Response time for conversation API: < 2 seconds
- Memory retrieval time: < 200ms
- Document processing: < 5 seconds per page
- UI responsiveness: Time to interactive < 1.5 seconds

**Example Performance Test:**
```javascript
// k6 script for API performance testing
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check, sleep } from 'k6';

export const options = {
  vus: 10,
  duration: '30s',
  thresholds: {
    http_req_duration: ['p(95)<2000'], // 95% of requests should be below 2s
  },
};

export default function () {
  const payload = JSON.stringify({
    message: 'Hello, AI assistant!',
  });
  
  const params = {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
  };
  
  const res = http.post('http://localhost:8000/api/conversation', payload, params);
  
  check(res, {
    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
    'response has conversation_id': (r) => r.json().conversation_id !== undefined,
    'response time < 2s': (r) => r.timings.duration < 2000,
  });
  
  sleep(1);
}
```

**Example Vector Search Benchmark:**
```python
@pytest.mark.benchmark
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_vector_search_performance():
    # Arrange
    vector_db = VectorDatabase(TEST_VECTOR_DB_DIR)
    
    # Create 1000 test embeddings
    ids, vectors, metadatas, texts = create_test_embeddings(1000, 384)
    await vector_db.batch_add_embeddings(ids, vectors, metadatas, texts)
    
    # Generate query vector
    query_vector = generate_random_embedding(384)
    
    # Act & Assert - measure search time
    start_time = time.time()
    results = await vector_db.search_similar(vector=query_vector, limit=10)
    end_time = time.time()
    
    search_time = (end_time - start_time) * 1000  # convert to ms
    print(f"Search time: {search_time:.2f}ms")
    
    assert search_time < 200, f"Search took too long: {search_time:.2f}ms"
    assert len(results) == 10
    
    # Cleanup
    await vector_db.close()
```

### Security Testing

Security tests verify that the application is secure against various threats.

**Tools**:
- Bandit for Python static analysis
- ESLint security plugins for JavaScript/TypeScript
- OWASP Dependency Check for vulnerable dependencies
- OWASP ZAP for API security testing

**Key Security Test Areas**:
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication and authorization
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- API security (rate limiting, CSRF protection)
- Dependency vulnerabilities

**Example Security Test:**
```python
@pytest.mark.security
def test_input_sanitization():
    # Arrange
    payload = {
        "message": "<script>alert('XSS')</script>"
    }
    
    # Act
    response = app_client.post("/api/conversation", json=payload)
    
    # Assert
    assert response.status_code == 200
    
    # Get conversation to check if XSS was sanitized
    conversation_id = response.json()["conversation_id"]
    response = app_client.get(f"/api/conversation/{conversation_id}")
    
    # Verify that the script tags are escaped or sanitized
    messages = response.json()["messages"]
    for message in messages:
        assert "<script>" not in message["content"]
```

### Accessibility Testing

Accessibility tests verify that the application is usable by people with diverse abilities.

**Tools**:
- axe-core for automated accessibility testing
- Lighthouse for accessibility audits
- Manual testing with screen readers

**Key Accessibility Requirements**:
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Sufficient color contrast
- Proper ARIA attributes

**Example Accessibility Test:**
```typescript
describe('Accessibility', () => {
  it('should have no accessibility violations', () => {
    cy.visit('/chat');
    cy.injectAxe();
    cy.checkA11y();
  });
  
  it('should be navigable by keyboard', () => {
    cy.visit('/chat');
    cy.get('body').tab();
    cy.focused().should('have.attr', 'data-testid', 'message-input');
    cy.focused().tab();
    cy.focused().should('have.attr', 'data-testid', 'send-button');
  });
});
```

## Test Automation

The Personal AI Agent employs comprehensive test automation to ensure consistent quality.

### CI/CD Integration

Tests are automatically run as part of the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

**Workflow File**: `.github/workflows/test.yml`

**Automated Test Stages**:
1. Backend Unit Tests
2. Backend Integration Tests
3. Frontend Unit Tests
4. Frontend E2E Tests
5. Performance Tests (on main/develop branches)
6. Accessibility Tests (on main/develop branches)

**Test Triggers**:
- Pull requests to main or develop branches
- Direct pushes to main or develop branches
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Test Reports**:
- Test results are reported in GitHub Actions
- Code coverage reports are uploaded to Codecov
- Test artifacts (screenshots, videos, reports) are stored as workflow artifacts
- Test summary is posted as a comment on pull requests

### Local Test Execution

Developers can run tests locally during development.

**Backend Tests**:
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd src/backend

# Run unit tests
poetry run pytest tests/unit/

# Run integration tests
poetry run pytest tests/integration/

# Run all tests with coverage
poetry run pytest --cov=.

# Run specific test file
poetry run pytest tests/unit/services/test_memory_service.py
```

**Frontend Tests**:
```bash
# Navigate to web directory
cd src/web

# Run unit tests
pnpm test

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test -- --coverage

# Run specific test file
pnpm test -- __tests__/components/MessageInput.test.tsx

# Run E2E tests in interactive mode
pnpm cypress:open

# Run E2E tests in headless mode
pnpm cypress:run
```

### Test Data Management

The testing strategy includes a comprehensive approach to test data management.

**Test Data Sources**:
- Static fixtures for common test scenarios
- Factory functions for generating test data
- Recorded API responses for external services

**Test Database Handling**:
- Tests use isolated databases (SQLite in-memory, temporary ChromaDB)
- Database state is reset between tests
- Test data is cleaned up after test execution

**Mock Data**:
- External APIs are mocked using appropriate testing tools
- Mock implementations are provided for complex components
- Recorded responses are used for third-party services

### Continuous Monitoring

Test results are continuously monitored to identify issues early.

**Monitoring Aspects**:
- Test success rates
- Code coverage trends
- Performance benchmark trends
- Flaky test identification

**Actions on Test Failures**:
- Failed tests block pull request merging
- Critical test failures trigger notifications
- Performance regression triggers alerts
- Security vulnerabilities are prioritized for immediate fixing

## Quality Gates

The Personal AI Agent implements quality gates to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

### Code Coverage Requirements

Minimum code coverage requirements are enforced:

| Component | Line Coverage | Branch Coverage |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| Core Services | 90% | 85% |
| API Layer | 85% | 80% |
| UI Components | 80% | 75% |
| Utilities | 90% | 85% |

Pull requests that decrease code coverage significantly may be rejected.

### Linting and Static Analysis

Code quality is enforced through linting and static analysis:

**Backend**:
- Flake8 for PEP 8 compliance
- Mypy for type checking
- Bandit for security issues
- Black for code formatting

**Frontend**:
- ESLint for code quality
- TypeScript for type checking
- Prettier for code formatting
- ESLint security plugins for security issues

All linting and static analysis checks must pass before code can be merged.

### Performance Thresholds

Performance requirements are enforced through automated tests:

| Operation | P50 | P90 | P99 | Max |
|-----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Text Response | 1.5s | 2.5s | 4.0s | 6.0s |
| Voice Processing | 1.0s | 2.0s | 3.0s | 5.0s |
| Memory Retrieval | 150ms | 300ms | 500ms | 1.0s |
| Document Processing | 3.0s | 6.0s | 10.0s | 15.0s |

Performance regressions that exceed these thresholds will be flagged for review.

### Security Requirements

Security requirements are enforced through automated checks:

- No critical or high severity vulnerabilities in dependencies
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Proper input validation and sanitization
- Secure communication (TLS, encryption)
- Proper authentication and authorization

Security issues must be addressed before code can be merged.

## Test Environment

The Personal AI Agent uses multiple test environments to ensure comprehensive testing.

### Local Development Environment

Developers use their local machines for initial testing:

- Unit tests run in isolation with mocked dependencies
- Integration tests use local databases and services
- E2E tests use a fully functional local environment

**Setup Instructions**:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/personal-ai-agent.git
cd personal-ai-agent

# Set up backend
cd src/backend
poetry install

# Set up frontend
cd ../web
pnpm install

# Run tests
cd ../backend
poetry run pytest

cd ../web
pnpm test
```

### CI Environment

The CI environment runs tests in a clean, isolated environment:

- GitHub Actions runners with specified Python and Node.js versions
- Fresh dependencies installed for each run
- Isolated databases and services
- No persistent state between runs

The CI environment is configured in the GitHub Actions workflow files.

### Staging Environment

The staging environment is used for pre-release testing:

- Deployed application with real (but isolated) services
- Test data that mimics production scenarios
- Performance testing under realistic conditions
- User acceptance testing

The staging environment is automatically updated with each successful build on the develop branch.

### Production Monitoring

Production monitoring complements pre-deployment testing:

- Error tracking and reporting
- Performance monitoring
- Usage analytics (with user consent)
- Automated alerts for issues

Production monitoring helps identify issues that weren't caught in pre-deployment testing.

## Test Documentation

Comprehensive test documentation ensures maintainability and knowledge sharing.

### Test Plans

Test plans are created for major features and releases:

- Test objectives and scope
- Test scenarios and cases
- Test data requirements
- Test environment setup
- Test execution schedule

Test plans are stored in the `docs/test-plans/` directory.

### Test Reports

Test reports are generated for each test run:

- Test results summary
- Failed test details
- Code coverage metrics
- Performance metrics
- Issues and recommendations

Test reports are available in the CI/CD pipeline and as downloadable artifacts.

### Test Case Documentation

Test cases are documented within the test code:

- Clear test names that describe the behavior being tested
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for clarity
- Comments explaining complex test scenarios
- Documentation of test data and mocks

Example of well-documented test:
```python
def test_should_retrieve_context_based_on_query_similarity():
    """Test that the memory service retrieves context based on semantic similarity to the query.
    
    This test verifies that:
    1. The query is converted to an embedding
    2. Similar memories are retrieved based on vector similarity
    3. Results are ranked by relevance
    4. The context is formatted correctly for the LLM
    """
    # Arrange
    mock_memory_storage = AsyncMock()
    mock_memory_retriever = AsyncMock()
    mock_memory_retriever.retrieve_context.return_value = [
        {"id": "1", "content": "Memory 1", "metadata": {"importance": 3}},
        {"id": "2", "content": "Memory 2", "metadata": {"importance": 1}}
    ]
    mock_memory_retriever.format_context_for_llm.return_value = "Memory 1\nMemory 2"
    
    memory_service = MemoryService(
        memory_storage=mock_memory_storage,
        memory_retriever=mock_memory_retriever,
        context_manager=AsyncMock(),
        event_bus=AsyncMock()
    )
    
    # Act
    result = await memory_service.retrieve_context(
        query="Test query",
        filters={"category": "test"}
    )
    
    # Assert
    mock_memory_retriever.retrieve_context.assert_called_once_with(
        query="Test query",
        filters={"category": "test"},
        limit=10
    )
    mock_memory_retriever.format_context_for_llm.assert_called_once()
    assert result == "Memory 1\nMemory 2"
```

## Troubleshooting and Debugging

Guidelines for troubleshooting and debugging test failures.

### Common Test Issues

Common issues that may cause test failures:

- **Flaky Tests**: Tests that fail intermittently due to timing, concurrency, or external dependencies
- **Environment Issues**: Differences between local and CI environments
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Incompatible or missing dependencies
- **Resource Limitations**: Tests failing due to memory, CPU, or disk constraints
- **Test Data Problems**: Missing, corrupt, or incompatible test data

### Debugging Strategies

Strategies for debugging test failures:

- **Isolate the Issue**: Run the failing test in isolation
- **Increase Verbosity**: Use `-v` or `--verbose` flags for more detailed output
- **Debug Mode**: Use debugging tools (pdb, debugger statements)
- **Logging**: Add temporary logging to identify the failure point
- **Simplify**: Reduce test complexity to isolate the issue
- **CI Artifacts**: Examine logs, screenshots, and videos from CI runs

### Handling Flaky Tests

Approaches for handling flaky tests:

1. **Identify**: Tag known flaky tests with `@pytest.mark.flaky` or similar
2. **Isolate**: Move flaky tests to a separate suite
3. **Stabilize**: Address root causes (timing issues, race conditions)
4. **Retry**: Use retry mechanisms for inherently flaky operations
5. **Replace**: Rewrite tests to be more deterministic

Flaky tests should be addressed promptly to maintain test suite reliability.

## Contributing to Tests

Guidelines for contributing to the test suite.

### Test Writing Guidelines

Guidelines for writing effective tests:

- **Test One Thing**: Each test should verify a single behavior
- **Independent Tests**: Tests should not depend on each other
- **Clear Names**: Test names should describe the behavior being tested
- **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Structure tests with clear setup, action, and verification
- **Minimal Mocking**: Mock only what's necessary
- **Test Edge Cases**: Include tests for boundary conditions and error scenarios
- **Performance Awareness**: Avoid unnecessarily slow tests

### Test Review Process

Process for reviewing test contributions:

1. **Automated Checks**: Linting, formatting, and coverage checks
2. **Peer Review**: Code review by another developer
3. **Verification**: Confirmation that tests actually test the intended behavior
4. **Performance Review**: Ensuring tests don't unnecessarily slow down the test suite
5. **Documentation Review**: Checking that tests are well-documented

### Test Maintenance

Guidelines for maintaining the test suite:

- **Regular Cleanup**: Remove obsolete tests
- **Refactoring**: Improve test structure and organization
- **Dependency Updates**: Keep test dependencies up to date
- **Performance Optimization**: Identify and optimize slow tests
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep test documentation current
